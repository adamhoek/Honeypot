# Honeypot
Modern Honey Network (MHN)

Deplyed Dionaea over HTTP honeypot.  
Challenges: I was concerned about the following error message:
 - The resource 'projects/ubuntu-os-cloud/global/images/ubuntu-1404-trusty-v20171010' is deprecated. A suggested replacement is 'projects/ubuntu-os-cloud/global/images/ubuntu-1404-trusty-v20181114'.
Correcting the trusty-version in the installer removes the error, and produces a threat map, but no admin console.

Note the inital attacks from Mexico City.  That's me.  As you can see, I was quickly joined by friends from around the world.



The majority of attacks are Packet Capture (PCAP)
